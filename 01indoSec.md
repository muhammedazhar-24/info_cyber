## Information security vs Cybersecurity
|*Aspect*                  |*Information security (infosec)*                                                                                    |*Cybersecurity*                                                            |

|*Definition*              |Protection of all forms of information (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.|Protection of digital assets, systems, networks, and data from cyberattack orinating through the internet or other digit means |             
|*Scope*                   |Broader - includes sdata in any form** (printed, spoken, written, or electronic).                                     |Narrower - focuses specifically on digital and network-based threats       | 
|*Objective*               |Ensure ++Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** of information, regardless of medium.                   |Protect computers, networks, servers, and data from online attacks, breach,and malware.| 
|*Primary focus*           |Data protection (physical & digital).                                                                                 |System and network defense (digital only).                                   |

## Simplified Understanding
Information Security = Protecting all kinds of information

*Digital + Physical

In short: 
cybersecurity is a subset of information security.

| Situation                                       |Infosec view                                                 |cybersecurity                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|A hacker steals customer detabase from a website |concerned about **loss of confidentiality** of customer data | concerned about **how the hacker breached the server** and **network vulnerbilities**.|
|Employee prints cinfidential data and leaks it   |**Handlrd under Infosec**(physical and breach).              | Not considered a **cyber** issue (no digital attack involved.                         |
